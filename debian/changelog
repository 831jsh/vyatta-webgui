vyatta-webgui (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Checkpoint release

  [ root ]
  * initial support for node name and help for operational command
    structure. behavior is similar to configuration request. op mode
    data can be retrieved with mode="op" attribute.
  * fixed permission on touch gui file. added op configuration support
    for dynamic and static enumeration values and for multinode node
    types.
  * added support for op mode commands. now return unmodified (except
    for '\n' conversion) output from op mode shell.
  * changed op mode node name from multi to node.tag for multinodes.

  [ An-Cheng Huang ]
  * fix backend op mode detection
  * fix backend op response format
  * fix backend op response special character escaping
  * add basic op commands support in gui front-end

  [ root ]
  * added <action> tag to op mode node that contains a "run" action in
    the template. Note that this definition can be expanded to config
    mode, but currently only sets this node for an op mode configuration
    request.
  * strip out comments in allowed template keyword--these are values
    that are enclosed by "<" and ">". will need to have these statements
    migrated to help in the operational mode template files.
  * modified error return code for op mode commands, now based on error
    value returned from popen call rather than response string.

    enclosed within single quotes. Validation is against operation mode
    template. currently arguments are
  * initialize variable being compared--caused failure in validation of
    op command.wq

  [ An-Cheng Huang ]
  * remove compiler warning

  [ slioch ]
  * added more single quotes to protect against rogue hidden cmds. also
    modified mass replace to allow for replacement=victim value.
  * limit incoming request size to 8192 bytes. On requests exceeding
    8192 bytes the request is dropped and the binary exits with no
    response

  [ An-Cheng Huang ]
  * 64-bit fix for gui backend
  * fix debian lighttpd cgi config file
  * merge Kevin's Vyatta GUI work from phuket
  * remove obsolete files

    problems

  [ Kevin Choi ]
  * changed tree view to display parent leaf only
  * retrack meraged
  * fixed mereged conflicts
  * Improved tree and editor views to display the set values indicator
    correctly
  * Minor changed to discard command.

  [ slioch ]
  * added recursive data mode to getconfig command. This allows a full
    get of the configuration tree

  [ Kevin Choi ]
  * add comment text to all action buttons
